# Papers

This repository contains a list of papers that I (co-)authored. The papers span a wide range of topics, including machine learning, technology assessment and theoretical computer science. The list is not exhaustive, but I try to keep it up-to-date. The papers are sorted by year of publication.

If you have any questions or feedback, feel free to reach out to me via email at [philip.laskowicz@web.de](mailto:philip.laskowicz@web.de). The

    - [Ahle Wurst trifft KI](2024/ai_meets_ahle_wurst.pdf) (AI meets Ahle Wurst)  
        **Abstract (translated):** Artificial intelligence offers opportunities for examining datasets to make predictions and discover new connections within the data. This paper presents some approaches to identifying correlations and predicting data, which are applied to a sample dataset from sausage production. The study addresses whether AI can predict the maturation process of raw sausage and determine its maturation level based on the available data. Additionally, it investigates which features of the data are interconnected and how the selection of required sensors can be optimized.  
        This paper was written a bachelor's seminar paper in the area of practical computer science at the University of Kassel and is provided in German.

    - [E-Voting - eine Gefahr f√ºr unsere Demokratie?](2022/e-voting_assessment.pdf) (E-Voting - a threat to our democracy?)  
        **Abstract (translated):** With increasing digitalization in society, elections are also coming into focus. Various technologies are available to support this effort, including voting machines and digital voting pens for in-person elections, and online voting or email voting as alternatives to traditional mail-in voting for absentee ballots. However, these advancements carry significant risks for society and democracy. Not only must voter perspectives be considered, but the security of the hardware and software employed is crucial. Additionally, laws and regulations must adapt to these new conditions, and any ambiguities must be addressed.  
        This paper was written as part of the course "Technology Assessment" at the University of Kasel and is provided in German.

    - [Ladner's Theorem](2022/ladners_theorem.pdf)  
        **Abstract (translated):** The question of whether \( P = NP \) or \( P \neq NP \) remains unresolved in theoretical computer science. Assuming \( P \neq NP \), Ladner demonstrated that there exist problems within the complexity class \( NP \) that are neither in \( P \) nor \( NP \)-complete. These are termed \( NP \)-intermediate problems. This paper explores the details of Ladner's Theorem and proves the existence of \( NP \)-intermediate problems. The proof follows the exposition in *Computational Complexity: A Modern Approach* by Sanjeev Arora and Boaz Barak, constructing a problem \( SATH \) by padding instances of the SAT problem. It is shown that \( SATH \) neither belongs to \( P \) nor is \( NP \)-complete, confirming the existence of \( NP \)-intermediate problems.

    - [Solid-State-Drives and their underlying memory architecture](2019/SSD_memory_architecture.pdf)   
        This document provides an overview of Solid-State Drives (SSDs) and their underlying memory architecture. It explains the operation of flash memory cells, the differences between NOR and NAND arrangements, and the storage capabilities of Single-Level Cell (SLC), Multi-Level Cell (MLC), and Triple-Level Cell (TLC) technologies. Additionally, it discusses the critical functions of SSD controllers, including error correction, wear-leveling, and garbage collection, essential for maintaining data integrity and optimizing SSD performance.  
        It was written as a substitution for an exam in a high school advanced physics course.
